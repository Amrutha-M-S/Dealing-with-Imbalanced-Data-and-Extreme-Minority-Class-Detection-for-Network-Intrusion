# Dealing-with-Imbalanced-Data-and-Extreme-Minority-Class-Detection-for-Network-Intrusion
The project “Extreme minority class detection in imbalanced data for network intrusion” aim is to completely and accurately detect any minority classes in the network intrusion dataset regardless of how low the instances they occurred are. 
The dataset used is CICIDS 2017 dataset,which is a benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection and contains labeled network flows and attacks to develop the intrusion detection model. Deep Neural Network is utilized to train the model and test it to observe if it’s able to work accurately for minority classes as well. The project addresses the effects that influence the detection performance of minority classes when working with original, non-resampled network traffic data.
